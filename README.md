# Turing Machine

Simple turing machine for multiplication of two integers.

Written in native Python 3 without any external dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
python turingmachine.py multiplier multiplicand [--interactive] [--sleep] [--print] [--clear]
```

### Flags:

- `--interactive`: Step through each step using enter. By default the machine just runs all at once.
- `--sleep`: Wait 0.1s between each step
- `--print`: Print the current state of the machine after each step
- `--clear`: Clear the screen before printing a new step
